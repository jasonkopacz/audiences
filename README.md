# How to run

You'll need to open two terminals to run this project. Point your directory to ./campagin_reach_frontend for one of the terminals. Run `npm install` or whichever package manager you use. Then run `npm run dev`. In the second terminal navigate to ./campaign_reach_backend and start a python virtual environment. `source env/bin/activate` or `python3 -m venv env` Then run `python3 manage.py runserver`. Now you can navigate your browser to `http://localhost:5173/` where you will see the project and from there you can upload the data files and view the created charts.

Please email me at jtkopacz@gmail.com if you're having trouble setting the project up.
Thanks!
